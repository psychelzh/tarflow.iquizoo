The goal of tarflow.iquizoo is to provide workflow auto-generation for IQUIZOO data powered by [targets](https://github.com/wlandau/targets) package.

## Background

The preprocessing of IQUIZOO data used to be very harduous because the datasets were very disorganized. Newer version of database and games make things much better. Now there is a package called [dataproc.iquizoo](https://github.com/psychelzh/dataproc.iquizoo), containing all the required functions used in preprocessing. It facilitates analysis significantly. For now, with the advent of [targets](https://github.com/wlandau/targets), we can easily setup workflows to automate all the preprocessing! This is what this package does. Hopefully, it will make the analysis of IQUIZOO data a favorable thing.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("psychelzh/tarflow.iquizoo")
```

## Example

If you are using R in interactive mode (typically when using *RStudio*), there will be a simple wizard to guide your setup. It will prompt you to choose the correct actions.

``` r
# invoke setup wizard
tarflow.iquizoo::init()
```

Essentially, file `_targets.R` will be created in which lists a pipeline that can be used by targets package. You can run the pipeline with the following line of code:

``` r
targets::tar_make()
```

Or if you prefer to run on multicores (note you can only do this when you separate works into branches), use this:

``` r
# set the number of works in the `workers` argument
targets::tar_make_future(workers = <numeric>)
```
